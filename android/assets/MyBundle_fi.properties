TUTORIAL_TEXT_001 = Welcome, travelers, to the town of Sysilehto. We are a small community, and lack skilled explorers of our own. We hope you will be able to help us with our problems!
TUTORIAL_TEXT_002 = This building is the tavern. Our tavernkeeper, Angus, moderates the “Job Board” where you will find various job requests. Let’s go take a look!
TUTORIAL_TEXT_003 = Here’s a bill I posted earlier. Tap it to see the details.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_004 = Here you can check the details of the quest: completion time and reward.\nTap Accept.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_007 = Great. Tap “Embark” to start the quest!
TUTORIAL_TEXT_008 = This is the adventuring screen. Here you can see important information about the progress you make and about your party members and their health.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_009 = This is the Log. It contains information about the events that happen during your adventure.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_010 = This is your party display. You can see your party members’ equipment and stats by tapping on them.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_012 = Oh! Looks like we have company. A rabid wolf is about to attack!
TUTORIAL_TEXT_013 = Each quest contains 1-3 combat phases, depending on the length of the quest. These will require confirmation to initiate, so don’t worry about being ambushed while you’re not on your phone! 
TUTORIAL_TEXT_014 = Press “Start Encounter” to begin the combat phase.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_015 = Combat is handled automatically, but you can see what happens in the Log Window.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_016 = Oh no! Looks like Bill is in quite a bad shape. Luckily, we can do something about that!
TUTORIAL_TEXT_018 = Try healing Bill now by tapping on the “Heal Party” button!
TUTORIAL_TEXT_019 = I have provided you with (n) steps to use this feature. You will have to gather more yourself by walking!
TUTORIAL_TEXT_020 = Great! Bill is feeling fine again. However, the cost of healing and speeding up rises every time you use these features, so you can’t rely on them! The cost resets when you finish the quest.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_021 = Now, take on that wolf!
TUTORIAL_TEXT_022 = Whew! We survived with minor injuries. Now all that’s left is to go back to the village. Simply wait for the timer to run out.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_023 = Great job! This is the rewards screen. Tap “Finish” to go back to town.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_024 = If you’re feeling beat up, you can restore your party to full health by visiting the Inn. Tap it to go there now.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_025 = This is Emilia, our innkeeper. She will provide you with lodgings to rest and recover. This night is on me, but you will have to pay gold for your next visits.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_026 = Good morning! You’re looking fine and healthy. I still have one more building to show, so tap it to enter!
TUTORIAL_TEXT_027 = This is the Shoppe. Our blacksmith, Oliver, will supply you with equipment that will help you on your adventures. Here’s some gold, so buy a helmet for Mick!
TUTORIAL_TEXT_028 = You’re now the proud owner of a brand-new helmet! Let’s go equip it now.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_029 = This is the Equipment screen. Here you can see the items you own and the items your party is currently wearing.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_030 = Items have four different quality tiers: Standard, Refined (green border), Artisan (blue border) and Masterwork (gold border). The higher the tier, the higher the item’s stats will be.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_031 = Try dragging the helmet from the inventory to Mick’s armor slot now!
TUTORIAL_TEXT_032 = Looking fine! There are three slots for each party member; weapons increase your damage dealt during quests, armor reduces damage taken during quests, and “Special” items grant various bonuses to help you survive the perils of the forest.
TUTORIAL_TEXT_033 = You are now ready to go out and help people on your own. We are relying on you to make our town a better place to live for everyone. So long!
